## Don't use this module

This module is a naive implementation of pubsub. It broadcasts all messages to all network peers, cannot provide older messages and has no protection against bad actors.

It exists for academic purposes only, you should not use it in production.

Instead please use [gossipsub](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainsafe/libp2p-gossipsub) - a more complete implementation which is also compatible with floodsub.

## Usage

```JavaScript
import { createLibp2pNode } from 'libp2p'
import { floodsub } from '@libp2p/floodsub'

const node = await createLibp2pNode({
  pubsub: floodsub()
  //... other options
})
await node.start()

node.pubsub.subscribe('fruit')
node.pubsub.addEventListener('message', (evt) => {
  console.log(evt)
})

node.pubsub.publish('fruit', new TextEncoder().encode('banana'))
```
